# [CropMate - MERN, Flask, Machine Learning]

> CropMate is a comprehensive agricultural project aimed at revolutionizing farming practices by leveraging technology and data-driven insights. It consists of several components, including a React web application, a mobile application developed using a server-side MERN Stack backend, and ensembled machine learning model for  precise recommendation for the crops based on soil parameters.

## Features
- **Crop Recommendation**: Utilizes machine learning algorithms to provide personalized crop recommendations based on soil and environmental data.
- **RestAPIs**: Single API calls for web app.
- **Secure**: The web app is secured with Brypt and JWT libraries.
- **Community Forum**: Facilitates knowledge sharing and collaboration among farmers through a dedicated forum.
- **User Authentication**: Users can sign up, log in, and log out securely.

## Technologies Used

- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database used for storing user data, posts, and other information.
- **Express.js**: Web application framework for building APIs and handling HTTP requests.
- **React.js**: Frontend library for building user interfaces.
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime environment used for server-side logic.
- **Mongoose**: MongoDB object modeling tool for Node.js.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Used for user authentication and authorization.
- **Bcrypt**: Used for encrypting user passwords.
- **Mongoose**: MongoDB object modeling tool for Node.js.
- **Flask**: Micro web framework written in Python used to load and run the ML model and interact with it.


## Project Structure
The project is organized into the following folders:

- **Server**: Houses the backend server implementation using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js).
- **Client**: Contains the code for the web application frontend, developed using React.js.
- **ML**: Includes the machine learning module responsible for crop recommendation, implemented using Python.
